Author comment: As of right now, I am confident in saying that this addon is feature complete. I am totally aware that I haven't covered every
                small detail related to minecraft's sandbox nature, e.g flowers or crops being destroyed due to piston extensions.
                With that said, I could continue bringing more vanilla parity and bring small and slow updates as time goes on. This options depends
                on the tech that we as developers have available to us. Or, add features that somewhat fit the theme of the addon, e.g the addition of
                a lobster pot. This could make the addon broad of scope and not so focused. Or finally, do nothing and conclude the addon with only QoL
                changes and bug fixes.
                Would love some feedback, you can either comment on the curseforge page, github issues, or message me via discord @ beardedflea

Author comment: Just my luck to have mojang push out an update just after I update my addon. This should be fine on v1.21.20
                The good news is that the betaAPIs experiment can be turned off.
                Also i forgot to update both manifest.jsons to the corresponding addon versions. Whoopsie
