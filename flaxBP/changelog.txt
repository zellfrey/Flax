v1.2.1
    Scripts:
        - Removed behaviour for water breaking for flax crops and flowers
        - Removed composter compability functionality
        - Slab behaviour has been changed. onPlayerInteract has been replaced with beforeOnPlayerPlace,
          so you don't need to sneak in order to place blocks next to the slab
        - Rope onPlayerInteract has been removed
        - Rope item has onUseOn. Allows for easier placement of blocks around and under the rope.
          Sneaking with rope and interacting with a rope end piece creates a full length of rope.
          This was originally done by using shears.
    Blocks:
        - Waterlogging added for all blocks
        - Flax crops & Flax Flowers now have proper water detection similar to vanilla plants
        - Flax crop visuals have been updated "facing_dimming = false", it's brighter and more vibrant
        - Flax crops/seeds have been fixed to only allow being placed on farm blocks.(How did i miss this?)
    Items:
        - Flax Flower & Flax Seeds now have proper composter compability
Author comment:
        Nice to see some more interactions available to addons. This should make the addons more cohesive
        to the vanilla experience. When minecraft:climbable?
        Please note. Water detection and composter compability requires UCF, basically, in order to get the
        most out of this update; TURN ON UPCOMING CREATOR FEATURES

Author comment: As of right now, I am confident in saying that this addon is feature complete. I am totally aware that I haven't covered every
                small detail related to minecraft's sandbox nature, e.g flowers or crops being destroyed due to piston extensions.
                With that said, I could continue bringing more vanilla parity and bring small and slow updates as time goes on. This options depends
                on the tech that we as developers have available to us. Or, add features that somewhat fit the theme of the addon, e.g the addition of
                a lobster pot. This could make the addon broad of scope and not so focused. Or finally, do nothing and conclude the addon with only QoL
                changes and bug fixes.
                Would love some feedback, you can either comment on the curseforge page, github issues, or message me via discord @ beardedflea

Author comment: Just my luck to have mojang push out an update just after I update my addon. This should be fine on v1.21.20
                The good news is that the betaAPIs experiment can be turned off.
                Also i forgot to update both manifest.jsons to the corresponding addon versions. Whoopsie
