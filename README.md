# Flax - A bedrock addon


Flax is a simple and straight forward bedrock addon that adds a new crop and some new blocks, that should blend well with the vanilla experience. The addon is designed
to compliment the early to mid game vanilla experience, whilst also adding more options to currently existing minecraft items/blocks.
